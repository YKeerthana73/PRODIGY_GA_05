# Neural Style Transfer with TensorFlow

## Overview

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique that allows you to blend the artistic style of one image (e.g., a famous painting) with the content of another image (e.g., a photograph). This README provides a step-by-step guide to implementing NST using TensorFlow.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```
# Neural Style Transfer 

## Implementation Steps
### 1. Importing libraries

### 2. Load and Process Images

This step involves defining a method to load the content and style images. The process includes:

- **Resizing** the images to a standard dimension (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
- **Converting** the images into NumPy arrays.
- **Applying** any required preprocessing specific to the model, such as mean subtraction.

#### Sample Code

```python
# Function to load and preprocess images
def load_and_process_img(img_path):
    # Load the image from the specified path
    # Resize to target dimensions
    # Convert to array format
    # Apply model-specific preprocessing
```

## 3. Define Feature Extraction Model

In this section, we will utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically VGG19, to extract features from the content and style images. The VGG19 model is particularly effective for this purpose because it has been trained on a large dataset and captures rich visual features at various levels of abstraction.

```python
# Function to create the feature extraction model
def get_model():
    # Load the pre-trained VGG19 model without the top layer
    # Specify content and style layers
    # Return a model that outputs these layers
```

### 4. Define Loss Functions

In this step, we create functions to calculate the losses used in Neural Style Transfer:

- **Content Loss**: This measures the difference between the content of the target image and the content image.
- **Style Loss**: This measures the difference between the style representations of the target and style images.
``` python
# Function to compute content loss
def content_loss(base_content, target):
    # Calculate and return the content loss

# Function to compute style loss
def style_loss(base_style, target):
    # Calculate and return the style loss
```
### 5. Combine Losses

In this step, we combine the content and style losses into a total loss function. This function allows us to control the influence of each type of loss on the final output by applying weighting factors.
``` python
# Function to calculate total loss
def total_loss(content_weight, style_weight, content, style, target):
    # Combine content and style losses with weights
```
### 6. Optimization Setup

In this step, we set up an optimizer (such as Adam) to minimize the total loss. We also define a training step that calculates gradients based on the loss and updates the target image accordingly.
```python
# Set up optimizer and define the training step
optimizer = tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.02)

@tf.function
def train_step():
    # Use GradientTape to calculate gradients and update target image
```
### 7. Training the Model

In this step, we run a loop for a specified number of iterations (epochs) to perform the training. At regular intervals, we visualize the current state of the generated image to observe the progress.
``` python
# Loop for training
for i in range(epochs):
    train_step()
    # Visualize the current generated image at intervals
```
### 8. Display Final Image

After completing the training, we convert the final generated image from a tensor back into a displayable format (e.g., from tensor to array) and visualize it.
